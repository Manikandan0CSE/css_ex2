            <P>Storage Tips</P>

            * Store leafy greens in airtight containers or glass jars in the fridge to keep them fresh for longer.
            * Keep root vegetables in a cool, dark spot or in a breathable bag to maintain their freshness for up to a month.
            * Store cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower loosely in plastic bags in the fridge to prevent moisture buildup.
            * Whole onions can be stored in a cool, dark spot or in a breathable bag for up to a month.
            * Cucumbers and celery can be stored in plastic bags in the fridge for up to 1-2 weeks.
            * Fennel fronds can be frozen to make homemade vegetable stock.
            
            <P>Organizing and Labeling</P>

            * Use bins and baskets to organize and categorize vegetables in the store.
            * Label each bin or basket with its contents and expiration date to ensure easy identification and rotation.
            * Consider using a vegetable rack to keep all produce together, free up fridge space, and make it easier to see which vegetables are available.
